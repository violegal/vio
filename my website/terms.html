You must carefully consider the appropriateness of the proposed investments in light of your ow n personal financial circumstances, including cash flow needs, tax circumstances, or other complex or subjective concerns.</p>
                  <p>You are urged to use all available resources to educate yourself about investing in general, as well as the investments and the overall composition of your account. Additionally, market conditions and your personal financial circumstances may change â€“ perhaps suddenly or gradually over time.
